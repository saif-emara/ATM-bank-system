# ATM Simulation System

A simple command-line **ATM simulation** written in C++.  
This project mimics the interaction between a user and an ATM machine, offering basic banking operations in a menu-driven console format.

## 📌 Notes

- Console-based, no backend or database
- Data is stored in memory only during runtime
- No PIN/password logic implemented (can be added later)
- Focused on logical flow and usability
